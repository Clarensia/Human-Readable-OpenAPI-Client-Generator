    The blockchain-apis package allow you to interact with Blockchain
    APIs in a synchronous and asynchronous way.

    If you are starting on a new project, it is better to use the async
    class, which is called: BlockchainAPIs

    If you already have a project and don't want to bother with async,
    you can use the BlockchainAPIsSync class.
  # The modules that you want to be exported when someone write from package import *
  all-exports: ["BlockchainAPIs"]
model-module-description: |
  Contains the models that are returned by the Blockchain APIs instance
  class.

  These models are all dataclasses that have the slots and frozen set to True.

  - `slots=True` Allow you to have more optimized access to the data
  - `frozen=True` This way you can't modify the returned values from the API.
                Because what the API return is final it should not be modified.

  To access some data use the Python dot "." notation.

  For example:
  ```python
  blockchain_instance = Blockchain(
      blockchain="ethereum",
      name="Ethereum",
      chain_id=1,
      explorer="https://etherscan.io/"
  )

  # Get the id of the blockchain
  print(blockchain_instance.blockchain)
  ```

  Please note that you can't access the data with the dictionary notation:
  ```python
  blockchain_instance = Blockchain(
      blockchain="ethereum",
      name="Ethereum",
      chain_id=1,
      explorer="https://etherscan.io/"
  )

  # This will throw an exception, use the notation in the example
  # above please.
  print(blockchain_instance["blockchain"])
exception-module-description: |
  Contains the Exceptions that can be thrown from
  Blockchain APIs

  These exceptions are thrown when a call is made to Blockchain APIs
  and the response code is not 200 or 201
